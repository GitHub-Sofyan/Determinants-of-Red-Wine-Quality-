# Research Question: Which chemical properties influence the quality of red wines?

Background: Red Wine quality is graded by experts on a scale of 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent). To help understand what are the factors that determine the wine quality, the physicochemical properties of the wine was investigated. This is a qualititave measurement.

By examining the physicochemical properties of wines of different grades, it might be possible to investigate whether there are factors or variables that can help determine the quality of red wine. This can help to quantify some of the grading process of the what is eitherwise a very qualitative measurement. This information in turn can be used in the future to help create a preliminary grading of wine quality (based on quantifiable measures) or something smiliar alomg that line. An example is a predictive model (based on the variables) that will be able to provide guidance to vineyard to determine their quality (and price) quantifiable without the wine tasters that might be more volatile.

Therefore the quality of wine will be the dependent variable while the physicochemical properties of the wine will be the independent variables or factors.
